"""
02_2 integration: method implementations for the Python side.

One function per method, all with the same shape:

    method(adata, batch_key, label_key=None, seed=0, model_dir=None,
           model_prefix="", retrain=False) -> AnnData

so the dispatcher in run_integration.py can call them uniformly. Each returns
the object carrying whatever the metrics need for its output type:

    knn   (bbknn)                 -> corrected neighbour graph in .obsp / .uns
    embed (harmony, scvi, scanvi) -> obsm['X_emb']
    full + embed (scanorama)      -> corrected .X and obsm['X_emb']

BBKNN and Harmony are thin wrappers over scib.integration: they modify the object
in place and preserve cell order, so nothing extra is needed. model_dir /
model_prefix / retrain are ignored by everything except scVI and scANVI.

Scanorama is reimplemented here and NOT taken from scib.integration, because
`anndata.AnnData.concatenate` was removed in anndata 0.13. This version recreates
what the scib wrapper did, but preserves the input cell order by preallocating the
output arrays and writing each batch's corrected block back to its original row.

scVI and scANVI are reimplemented too, for a different reason: they are the two
long trainings of the phase (13 epochs over 619k cells for scVI, and scANVI redoes
those 13 before its own 4), and scib.integration gives no access to the fitted
model, so a failure anywhere after training throws the training away. The versions
below reproduce scib's call sequence and parametrisation exactly, adding only a
checkpoint to model_dir. See _fit_or_load_scvi for the details that must stay in
step with scib.

scib_compat must be imported by the caller before scib; this module assumes it.
