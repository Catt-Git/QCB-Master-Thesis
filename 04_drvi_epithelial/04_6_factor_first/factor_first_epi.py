"""04_6, Route B: factor-first. The dimension defines itself; prior knowledge only names it.

The unit of analysis is the GENE. The question is what gene program a dimension encodes,
irrespective of what anyone was looking for. This is the only discovery route in the step:
it can name dimensions nobody asked about, and it is the corrective for the confirmation
bias built into Route A, which by construction can only find states brought in from outside.

It is also the route that cashes in the property DRVI was chosen for over the higher-scoring
methods of the phase-02 benchmark: the additive decoder gives every dimension a directly
readable gene-level footprint. Without this stage any integration method would have done.

How it fails: gene-level enrichment says nothing about cells. A dimension can be strongly
enriched for a stemness list while being driven by a handful of cells, by a patient-specific
effect that happens to share part of the gene set, or by a dissociation stress response
overlapping the same genes. The top-gene list is also a truncation, so long diluted
signatures systematically under-enrich relative to short sharp ones - which is precisely why
step 5 refuses to call anything a cell state on this route alone.

Reused from 03_3_enrichment (`enrichment_nonimm.ipynb`), unchanged:
  * the `interpretability_scores` accessor, which rebuilds DRVI's genes x dimension-directions
    table from `embed.varm` alone - no model, no GPU, no scvi-tools;
  * reading each dimension in its TWO DIRECTIONS separately;
  * the HVG background, and `N_TOP_GENES = 200` as the list depth;
  * the OOD_combined scores, which favour the genes specific to a dimension.

Changed here:
  * the gene sets are the lab's collection (the .gmt of step 1) rather than the public
    libraries only. Hallmark 2020 is kept alongside it as a sanity-check collection, so a
    dimension that enriches for nothing in the custom sets can still be named;
  * every test runs OFFLINE against a declared background (`gp.enrich`, hypergeometric),
    never against Enrichr's implicit all-human-genes universe;
  * Benjamini-Hochberg is applied ONCE across all dimension-direction / gene-set pairs, not
    per query as Enrichr does. With 100+ directions a per-query FDR is far too permissive;
  * the output is a matrix on the SAME ROW ORDER as Route A, so the two heatmaps can be read
    side by side in step 5;
  * NOTHING IS PRUNED. 03_3 let DRVI's accessor drop the directions it had marked vanished;
    here `PRUNE_VANISHED = False` keeps all 2 x n_latent of them, so the enrichment is run
    on every axis the model has and the vanished flag is reported rather than acted on. It
    costs FDR denominator - every direction adds one test per gene set - and that cost is
    the honest one: the alternative is deciding which axes may carry a program before
    looking at any of them.

The gene universe, for the Methods: DRVI was trained on the 2,000 batch-aware HVGs of 04_1,
so a gene outside that set could never have entered a top-gene list and the ORA background
is the TRAINING FEATURE SET, not the transcriptome. The consequence, which has to be stated
rather than hidden: each signature is effectively tested in its HVG-restricted form, so a
list with few HVG members is under-powered here even though Route A scored it in full. Step
1 reports that column (`n_in_hvg_background`) for exactly this reason.

    python factor_first_epi.py --n-top-genes 500     # a deeper list
