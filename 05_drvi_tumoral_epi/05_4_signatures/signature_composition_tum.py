"""05_4b: what is actually inside each signature score - which genes carry it, and are they measurable.

`coverage_*.csv` counts how many symbols of a list map to the object. That is necessary and not
sufficient: a list can map 87% of its symbols and still produce a score that is, in this dataset,
a proxy for one housekeeping gene. `sc.tl.score_genes` averages the mapped genes, so a gene that
is expressed an order of magnitude above the rest of its list dominates the average no matter how
many other genes are in it, and genes below the droplet detection floor contribute nothing but
their zeros. Neither fact is visible in a mapping fraction.

This step opens the lists and reports, per gene and per signature:

  * `detection_rate`           - fraction of cells with a non-zero count. Under ~1% a gene is at
                                 the droplet noise floor and is not measuring anything per cell.
  * `share_of_mean_signal`     - the gene's share of the summed expression of its list, i.e. how
                                 much of the score's LEVEL it sets. Non-negative, sums to 1.
  * `share_of_score_variance`  - Cov(x_g / n, m) / Var(m) with m the list mean, i.e. how much of
                                 the score's spread ACROSS CELLS it sets. Sums to 1 and can be
                                 negative for a gene that moves against its own list. This is the
                                 sharper of the two: the ranking of cells is what every quadrant
                                 and every Spearman downstream is built on.
  * `spearman_with_score`      - the gene against the score the rest of the phase actually uses,
                                 joined from 05_6's `signature_scores_*.csv` when it exists.

and, per signature, the concentration summary that says whether the list behaves like a list:

  * `effective_n_genes`        - inverse Simpson on the mean-signal shares, 1 / sum(share^2). The
                                 number of genes the score behaves as if it had. A 15-gene list
                                 with an effective 2.1 is a two-gene score wearing a 15-gene name.
  * `frac_cells_all_zero`      - cells with zero counts across the WHOLE list. Their score is
                                 whatever the control set happened to be; it is not a measurement.

Three flags mark a list whose score should not be read as the biology its name claims:
`dominated_by_one_gene`, `low_effective_n`, `undetectable_in_many_cells`. They are reported, never
enforced: this step drops nothing and stops nothing. It is a diagnostic, and the decision it
informs belongs in the registry, with its reasoning written down - see `utils/sig_collections.py`
and the README section "Why EMP was dropped" for the one case where it has been acted on.

Runs AFTER 05_6, only so it can join the real scores; without them it still
writes both tables and says which column is missing.

Usage:
    export DATA_DIR=~/Desktop/QCB-Master-Thesis/datasets
    python signature_composition_tum.py                      # the scie collection, the default

# `effective_n_fraction` (effective / mapped) is REPORTED but deliberately NOT flagged. It was
# tried as a flag, on the reasoning that it measures the shape of a list independently of its
# length, and it does not work: every long list sits at 0.18-0.28 on this object - FMASC 0.27 with
# 457 effective genes, ESC_ASSOU 0.18 with 146 - because expression is heterogeneous across any
# few hundred genes, not because those lists are defective. The fraction is a property of the
# expression distribution, not a defect, and thresholding it flags the collection's most robust
# scores. What actually separated EMP was the ABSOLUTE effective count (2.17) together with a
# single dominant gene, which is what the two flags below already catch. The column stays because
# it is worth reading next to the absolute one; it is not a criterion.
