# verify_integrity.sh
# Post-download checks on the FASTQ files.
# 1) gzip integrity of every FASTQ.
# 2) R1 and R2 read lengths, to confirm the expected structure and to establish which file is the barcode
# (R1) and which is the cDNA (R2): R1 (barcode+UMI+padding) is 101bp for most samples and 151bp for 2 samples 
# (16bp barcode + 10bp UMI = 26bp effective, handled with --r1-length=26); R2 (cDNA) is the long biological 
# read and starts with the 5'v1 TSO AAGCAGTGGTATCAAC.

# Usage: DATA_DIR=/path/with/space bash verify_integrity.sh
# (or FASTQ_DIR=/explicit/folder bash verify_integrity.sh to check a different folder)
# On the cluster (how the thesis run was done) this is launched through 'sbatch submit_verify_integrity.slurm',
# which sets DATA_DIR, keeps a copy of the report and turns any CORRUPTED line into a non-zero exit
# (this script always exits 0 by design, see below).

set -uo pipefail
# Exit on undefined variables and pipe failures;
# note -e is intentionally omitted so a single corrupted file does not abort the whole check loop.
