# Recover ENA metadata for the entire BioProject PRJNA1032700 (Shiao et al., Cancer Cell 2024; DOI 10.1016/j.ccell.2023.12.012).
# Useful to distinguish human GEX libraries from TCR/BCR and mouse samples, to reconstruct the SRR -> patient/timepoint/fraction (P/N) association from 'library_name', and to record the expected number of FASTQ files per run (2 per run; 0 for SRR26541168, which is empty on ENA).

# Provenance: ENA API filereport (public endpoint, result=read_run).
# OUTPUT: ena_full_metadata.tsv (one row per SRR, incl. header; fields: run_accession,sample_accession,sample_title,library_strategy,library_source,library_selection,library_name,experiment_title,fastq_md5,fastq_ftp)
# Note on fastq_md5: these MD5s refer to the files AS SERVED BY ENA. Since the pipeline downloads via prefetch + fasterq-dump (which rebuilds FASTQ from the .sra, not the ENA file), local MD5s will NOT match these. Use fastq_md5 only as a source of truth for the expected file count per run.
